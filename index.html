<h2>What is social Media?</h2>

<br>
<p>
<strong>Twitter, Tik Tok, Facebook,</strong>and >other social media platforms can do a lot of good — they help us stay connected to friends and family.

They can also offer support systems for everything from social issues to losing weight.

However, there’s also the not-so-great side of social media.

If you’ve watched “The Social Dilemma” on Netflix, you might even be considering deleting all of your accounts for fear of being manipulated and used by the platforms.

But it doesn’t have to be all or nothing.

Learn the negative effects of social media below and find out whether you should take a break, plus the best ways to do so.

<h2 class="h2">The Negative Effects of Social Media and How to Take a Break</h2>
<br>
<h2>1:Feelings of Anxiety and Depression</h2>
<img src="pic2.jpg" alt="despressed" width="700" height="500">
<br>
<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5904786/">study published in the American Journal of Health Behavior</a> found an association between greater time spent on social media and increased risk for depression and anxiety.

Several things seem to be at play here:

For one, “feedback on posts can make people anxious if they don’t get enough likes, comments, or reactions,” says licensed clinical psychologist Dustin Weissman, PsyD. “Those reactions can also lower one’s mood if they are critical, negative, or harsh.”

For another, since everyone posts “perfect” images, “we can’t help but compare ourselves and wonder why we’re not doing as well,” explains Brian Wind, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist and chief clinical officer of JourneyPure.

Some mental health experts have even proposed that “social media anxiety” be its own disorder.

<h2>2. Low Self-Esteem </h2>
<br>
<img src="pic3.jpg" width="700" height="500">
<p>It’s almost too easy to scroll through social media and feel inadequate seeing exotic vacation photos or perfectly styled selfies.

“But don’t forget that photos can be filtered and angled to give a specific appearance,” says Cody Braun, NASM performance enhancement specialist Cody Braun, CPT.

“Our view of what is real and natural becomes distorted when we obsess over what others portray as glamour and perfection. This can cause us to have unrealistic expectations, and when we do not reach these goals, we lose self-esteem. We start to doubt our abilities and worth based on the perception that others have achieved more than us,” he explains.

<strong>All of this can cause greater feelings of anxiety or depression.</strong>
</p>

<h2>3. Increased Stress</h2>
<img src="pic4.jpg" width="700" height="500">
<br>
<p>Nobody would ask for more stress in life, yet extra stress is one of the negative effects of social media.

To start, there’s a sense of pressure to keep up with all of the posts (hello, doom scrolling!).

“Imagine trying to run up a mountain that continually grows each minute as fast or even twice as fast as you can run up it,” Weissman says. “That is what trying to keep up with social media can feel like.”

Plus, those posts may have unsettling information or lead to debates with others, increasing stress levels.

Then there are feelings of inadequacy and fear of missing out (FOMO).<br>


Lastly, the more time we spend scrolling, the less time we have to engage in work as well as pleasure, says clinical psychologist <a href="https://findinnercalm.caJennifer"> Barbera</a>, Ph.D., C. Psych.

Procrastination is a surefire way to boost stress, and when we cut out stress-reducing activities like exercise or reading, it’s no wonder we feel more frazzled from all the scrolling.
</p>

<h2>4. Poor Sleep </h2>
<br>
<img src="pic5.jpg" width="700" height="500">
<br>
<p> Social media and sleep do not complement each other. First, our devices emit blue light, which disrupts circadian rhythms, making it harder to fall asleep.

Second, stress and anxiety from social media can lead to poor sleep patterns, Braun says.

Third, if you feel the need to respond to every single notification and message, you could stay up all night waiting, Weissman says.</p>
<h2>5. Cyberbullying</h2>
<br>
<img src="7.jpeg" alt="bullying" width="700" height="500">
<p>
    Before social media, bullying was something that was only possible to do face-to-face.
     However, now people can bully others online—anonymously or not.
      Today everyone knows <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-cyberbullying/">what cyberbullying is,</a> and most of us have seen what it can do to a person.
    While social media makes it easier to meet new people and make friends, it also enables cruel people to tear into others with little effort.
     Perpetrators of bullying can use the anonymity that (some) social networks provide to gain people's trust and then terrorize them in front of their peers.
      For instance, they might create a fake profile and act friendly to a classmate, then later betray and embarrass them online.
     <br> These online attacks often leave deep mental scars and even drive people to hurt themselves or take their own lives, in some cases.
       And as it turns out, cyberbullying doesn't just affect kids.
       Adults can become victims of online abuse, too.
       Since screens hide our faces,
       you can end up being a jerk on social media and other websites without even realizing it.
</p>
<h2>6. Distracts From Life Goals</h2>
<img src="dis.png" width="700" height="500" alt="distract">
<p>It’s so easy to get wrapped up in what’s going on in social media that people will neglect their real life goals.
     Instead of aiming for the dream job by obtaining useful skills, people tend to strive for internet stardom.
     <br>
    Achieving goals takes hard work and a good deal of motivation.
     Social media allows an easy outlet to distract us when we don’t feel like putting in the hard work,
      and we can end up going down a path where we simply don’t get things done because it becomes too easy to find a distraction.
